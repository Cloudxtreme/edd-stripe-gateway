==========================
The Simple Stripe Checkout payment gateway allows you to accept credit cards directly on your site through your Stripe.com account using the built-in Stripe Checkout Button.

When purchasing downloads through the Simple Stripe Checkout Gateway with Easy Digital Downloads for WordPress, users enter their credit card details during the checkout process and never leave your site, resulting in a better experience for the user, and more successful conversions for you.

Easy to setup
==========================
The Simple Stripe Checkout gives you basic Stripe checkout functionality without any of the extra plugin support you are paying for with the full plugin. Simply load in your Stripe API keys, upload a profile image and you're good to go. To see a live example, click 'purchase' on this page and then go through the checkout process. It's fast and simple!

This is ideal for simple sites that want to use Stripe instead of PayPal. <a href="https://halgatewood.com/docs/plugins/simple-stripe-checkout/">Documentation</a>Â is available.

Notes
==========================
- This plugin will not work with EDD taxes turned on.
- I totally recommend the <a href="j.mp/edd-stripe">official Stripe Payment Gateway found the in EDD Add-on section</a>. My plugin is a super basic payment gateway and offers less functionality on purpose. My plugin also does not work with the Recurring Payments extension and other quality plugins that the EDD crew develop.
- The Stripe API requires that CURL is installed on your server. Most hosts allow this but please check that you are able to use it before purchasing this plugin.
- Stripe is capable of working in over 130 currencies. If you would like to add more options to your EDD Settings, <a href="https://gist.github.com/halgatewood/654f75a64703665b9cd6">copy this gist to your theme's functions.php file</a>.
